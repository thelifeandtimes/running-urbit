# obelisk-urql skill

Master urql's differences from standard sql syntax and expected results.

## syntax overview

urQL is derived from SQL with significant variations that enhance readability, promote composability, and are consistent with set and relational theory.

## clause ordering

urQL syntax requires clauses in the internal evaluation order, not SQL's SELECT-first order:

1. FROM clause (with JOINs)
2. SCALARS clause
3. WHERE clause
4. GROUP BY clause
5. HAVING clause
6. SELECT clause
7. ORDER BY clause

## object qualification

Objects are qualified by database and namespace using dot notation:

```
<db-qualifier> ::=
  { <database>.<namespace>.
  | <database>..
  | <namespace>. }
```

- `<database>` defaults to the current-database property of the Obelisk agent
- `<namespace>` defaults to `dbo` (database owner)
- double dot `database..object` means "use default namespace dbo"
- single dot `namespace.object` means "use default database"
- the SQL "schema" concept is called NAMESPACE in urQL

## naming rules

- object names (databases, namespaces, tables, views, columns) follow hoon term rules: type @tas, lower-case alphanumeric and hyphens, must start alphabetic
- aliases may be mixed case (title case encouraged for readability), evaluation is case agnostic (T1 and t1 are the same alias)
- the keyword "inner" does not exist; inner joins are designated simply as JOIN

## literals

Literals are hoon data literals following aura rules. Key supported types:

| Aura | Description | Example |
|:-----|:------------|:--------|
| @da  | date | ~2024.10.27, 2024.10.27 |
| @dr  | timespan | ~d71.h19.m26.s24 |
| @f   | loobean | Y, N (not %.y %.n) |
| @if  | IPv4 address | .195.198.143.90 |
| @p   | ship name | ~sampel-palnet |
| @rs  | single float | .3.14, .-3.14 |
| @rd  | double float | .~3.14, .~-3.14 |
| @sd  | signed decimal | --20, -20 |
| @t   | UTF-8 cord | 'text', 'it\\\\'s' |
| @ub  | unsigned binary | 10.1011 |
| @ud  | unsigned decimal | 2.222 or 2222 |
| @ux  | unsigned hex | 0x12.6401 |

Cord values use single quotes. Embed single quotes with double backslash: `'it\\'s'`

Unsigned decimal can be written without the dot thousands separator (2222 instead of 2.222).

Dates and ships can optionally omit the leading `~` in INSERT.

## comments

```
:: line comment (two colons), comments out remainder of line
CREATE DATABASE db1; :: inline comment

/* block comment
must start with /* in columns 1 and 2
must end with */ in columns 1 and 2
*/
```

## no inlined sub-queries

Sub-queries must be referenced by the alias of a common table expression (CTE), never inlined. See CTE section below.

## results are always proper sets

- query results always return proper sets (no duplicate rows)
- there are no nulls; instead outer joins may return rows of varying lengths

## scripts

- multiple commands delimited by semicolons form a script
- scripts are atomic: all commands succeed or the entire script fails
- all commands in a script share the same timestamp (as if they happened simultaneously)
- once a SELECT appears in a script, all subsequent commands must also be SELECTs

## DDL commands

### implemented

```
CREATE DATABASE <database> [ <as-of-time> ]

CREATE NAMESPACE [ <database>. ] <namespace> [ <as-of-time> ]

ALTER DATABASE <database> RENAME TO <new-database>

ALTER NAMESPACE [ <database>. ] <namespace>
  TRANSFER TABLE [ <db-qualifier> ] <table>
  [ <as-of-time> ]

CREATE TABLE [ <db-qualifier> ] <table>
  ( <column> <aura> [ ,...n ] )
  PRIMARY KEY ( <column> [ ,...n ] )
  [ FOREIGN KEY ( <column> [ ,...n ] )
      REFERENCES [ <namespace>. ] <table> ( <column> [ ,...n ] )
      [ ON DELETE { RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET DEFAULT } ]
      [ ON UPDATE { RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET DEFAULT } ]
    [ ,...n ] ]
  [ <as-of-time> ]

ALTER TABLE [ <db-qualifier> ] <table>
  [ RENAME TO <table> ]
  [ COLUMNS ( <column> [ ,...n ] ) ]
  [ PRIMARY KEY ( <column> [ ,...n ] ) ]
  [ ADD COLUMN ( { <column> <aura> } [ ,...n ] ) ]
  [ DROP COLUMN ( <column> [ ,...n ] ) ]
  [ RENAME COLUMN ( { <column> TO <column> } [ ,...n ] ) ]
  [ ALTER COLUMN ( { <column> <aura> } [ ,...n ] ) ]
  [ ADD FOREIGN KEY ( <column> [ ,...n ] )
      REFERENCES [ <namespace>. ] <table> ( <column> [ ,...n ] )
      [ ON DELETE { RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET DEFAULT } ]
      [ ON UPDATE { RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET DEFAULT } ] ]
  [ DROP FOREIGN KEY ( <column> [ ,...n ] ) [ <namespace>. ] <table> ]
  [ <as-of-time> ]

DROP TABLE [ FORCE ] [ <db-qualifier> ] <table> [ <as-of-time> ]

 DROP NAMESPACE [ FORCE ] [ <database>. ] <namespace>

DROP DATABASE [ FORCE ] <database>
```

FORCE is required to drop populated tables or databases with populated tables. DROP DATABASE is permanent and leaves no trace for time travel.

### ALTER DATABASE

Renames an existing user database:

```
ALTER DATABASE db1 RENAME TO db2;
```

- `sys` cannot be renamed
- the target database name must not already exist
- the rename updates `sys.sys.databases` and records a schema change in the `sys` log
- once a query appears in a script, ALTER DATABASE cannot appear later in that same script

### ALTER NAMESPACE

Transfers an existing user table into another namespace:

```
ALTER NAMESPACE ns2 TRANSFER TABLE my-table;
ALTER NAMESPACE db2.ns2 TRANSFER TABLE db1..my-table AS OF ~2026.5.1;
```

- the target namespace may be in another database
- transfers in or out of database `sys` or namespace `sys` are invalid
- `AS OF` must be greater than both the latest schema timestamp and latest content timestamp
- historical reads through `AS OF` should still resolve the prior namespace/table state
- once a query appears in a script, ALTER NAMESPACE cannot appear later in that same script

### ALTER TABLE

Alters a table's name, canonical column order, primary key, and columns:

```
ALTER TABLE my-table
  RENAME TO renamed-table,
  COLUMNS (score, name, id, born),
  PRIMARY KEY (name, id),
  ADD COLUMN (created @da, balance @sd),
  DROP COLUMN (old-note),
  RENAME COLUMN (old-name TO name),
  ALTER COLUMN (score @sd)
  AS OF ~2026.5.1;
```

- at least one clause is required
- clauses are applied to produce a new schema version; `AS OF` queries can still read prior schema and contents
- `RENAME TO` changes the current table name within the namespace; use ALTER NAMESPACE to move a table
- `COLUMNS` sets canonical order after ADD, DROP, and RENAME have been applied
- `COLUMNS` must include every still-existing column, including newly added columns
- `COLUMNS` must change the existing canonical order; no-op reorderings fail
- if `COLUMNS` is omitted, added columns are appended and renamed columns retain their canonical positions
- added columns populate existing rows with each aura's bunt value
- `PRIMARY KEY` must reference existing columns, must change the existing key, and must be unique over existing data
- duplicate names in COLUMNS, PRIMARY KEY, ADD COLUMN, DROP COLUMN, RENAME COLUMN, or ALTER COLUMN fail
- `AS OF` must be greater than both latest schema and latest data timestamps

### FOREIGN KEY / referential integrity

Foreign keys are runtime-enforced. A child table's foreign-key columns must
match the complete primary key of the referenced parent table, in primary-key
order. Referenced parent columns must be exactly the parent table's full
`PRIMARY KEY`; partial keys and non-primary-key references are invalid.

```
CREATE TABLE parent (id @ud, label @t) PRIMARY KEY (id);
CREATE TABLE child
  (id @ud, parent-id @ud, note @t)
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
  FOREIGN KEY (parent-id) REFERENCES parent (id);
```

Composite foreign keys are declared in matching parent primary-key order:

```
CREATE TABLE parent
  (tenant-id @ud, code @ud, label @t)
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant-id, code);
CREATE TABLE child
  (id @ud, parent-tenant @ud, parent-code @ud)
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
  FOREIGN KEY (parent-tenant, parent-code)
    REFERENCES parent (tenant-id, code);
```

- default action is `RESTRICT` for both `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE`
- `RESTRICT` rejects parent changes while child rows reference the parent key
- `CASCADE` propagates parent key deletes/updates to child rows
- `SET DEFAULT` sets child key columns to their aura bunt values; the parent table must contain the bunt key
- `ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY` validates existing child rows at the effective content time
- `ALTER TABLE DROP FOREIGN KEY ( <child-columns> ) [ <namespace>. ] <parent-table>` removes enforcement for that relationship
- self-referential and cyclic foreign keys are allowed only when their actions do not create cascading cycles
- child-side `INSERT` and `UPDATE` reject missing parent keys

### not yet implemented

ALTER INDEX, CREATE INDEX, CREATE VIEW, DROP INDEX,DROP VIEW

## data manipulation commands

### INSERT

```
INSERT INTO <table> [ <as-of-time> ]
  [ ( <column> [ ,...n ] ) ]
  VALUES ( <value> [ ,...n ] ) [ ...n ]
```

- if column list is omitted, values must be in the table's canonical column order
- multiple value rows are NOT comma separated (each row is its own parenthesized group)
- the DEFAULT keyword specifies the column type's bunt (default) value
- INSERT from SELECT is parsed but not yet supported in Obelisk runtime

### DELETE

```
[ WITH [ <common-table-expression> [ ,...n ] ] ]
[ SCALARS { <name> <scalar-function> } [ ...n ]]
DELETE [ FROM ] <table> [ <as-of> ]
  WHERE <predicate>
```

- DELETE requires a WHERE predicate (unlike SQL)
- to delete all rows use TRUNCATE TABLE instead

### TRUNCATE TABLE

```
TRUNCATE TABLE [ <ship-qualifier> ] <table> [ <as-of-time> ]
```

Executes in O(1) time regardless of data volume.

### UPDATE

```
[ WITH [ <common-table-expression> [ ,...n ] ] ]
[ SCALARS { <name> <scalar-function> } [ ...n ]]
UPDATE [ <ship-qualifier> ] <table> [ <as-of> ]
  SET { <column> = <scalar-node> } [ ,...n ]
  [ WHERE <predicate> ]
```

- WHERE predicate is optional — omitting it updates every row
- the DEFAULT keyword in SET resets a column to its aura bunt value
- WITH CTEs, SCALARS, and AS OF are supported
- when no rows match the predicate the result message is `'no rows updated'` and no data-time is recorded

## SELECT (query)

```
[ FROM <relation> [ <as-of-time> ] [ [AS] <alias> ]
    { JOIN <relation> [ <as-of-time> ] [ [AS] <alias> ] }
    | { { JOIN | LEFT JOIN | RIGHT JOIN | OUTER JOIN }
          <relation> [ <as-of-time> ] [ [AS] <alias> ]
          ON <predicate> }
    | CROSS JOIN <relation> [ <as-of-time> ] [ [AS] <alias> ]
]
[ WHERE <predicate> ]
[ GROUP BY { <qualified-column> | <column-alias> | <column-ordinal> } [ ,...n ]
  [ HAVING <predicate> ]
]
[ SCALARS { <alias> <scalar-function> } ]
SELECT [ TOP <n> ]
  { * | { <table-or-alias>.* } | <expression> [ AS <column-alias> ] } [ ,...n ]
[ ORDER BY { <qualified-column> | <column-alias> | <column-ordinal> } { ASC | DESC } [ ,...n ] ]
```

- simplest query: `SELECT 0`
- SELECT without FROM can use literals and scalar functions
- SELECT from a CTE alias alone (no FROM) is valid

### current implementation status

- JOIN (inner, no ON predicate — natural join): supported
- JOIN with ON predicate: supported
- LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, OUTER JOIN: not yet supported
- CROSS JOIN: supported
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, TOP: parsed but not yet supported in engine
- aggregate functions: not yet implemented

## set operations

`UNION`, `EXCEPT`, and `INTERSECT` combine complete queries and are
evaluated left-to-right. Results are true sets: exact duplicate result
vectors are removed. Equality includes output column names, column order, and
auras, not just raw values.
Unlike SQL, operands are not required to return the same row type. `UNION` can
contain distinct row shapes side by side; `EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` only match
complete result vectors that are exactly equal.

- `UNION`: rows from either side
- `EXCEPT`: rows from the left side not present on the right
- `INTERSECT`: rows present on both sides
- set operations may be used in CTE bodies and by outer queries over CTEs
- if a set query contains `UNION`, every operand `SELECT` must have unique
  output column names
- `DIVIDED BY` and `DIVIDED BY WITH REMAINDER` parse but do not execute yet

## joins

### natural joins

Joins without an ON predicate. Obelisk joins on all columns shared between the two objects by matching name and aura type. The columns need not be primary keys.

- joining on full primary key columns is most efficient (indexed)
- joining on a partial primary key (leading columns only — trailing-only subsets are not valid) or on non-key columns requires a scan
- if no columns match by name and aura type, the query crashes

### JOIN ON predicate

The ON predicate may only contain column equality conditions joined by AND:

```
FROM adoptions A
JOIN vaccinations V ON A.name = V.name AND A.species = V.species
SELECT A.name, A.species, V.vaccine, V.vaccination-time;
```

No other operators or OR conjunctions are permitted in ON. For more complex join conditions use CROSS JOIN with WHERE filtering.

### CROSS JOIN

Cartesian join of two tables. Takes no predicate. Use with WHERE to implement complex join conditions:

```
FROM adoptions A
CROSS JOIN vaccinations V
WHERE A.name = V.name
  AND A.species = V.species
  AND V.vaccination-time > A.adoption-date
SELECT A.name, A.species, A.adoption-date, V.vaccine, V.vaccination-time;
```

## predicates

```
<predicate> ::=
  { [ NOT ] <predicate> | [ ( ] <simple-predicate> [ ) ] }
  [ { AND | OR } [ NOT ] <predicate> [ ...n ] ]

<simple-predicate> ::=
  expression <binary-operator> expression
  | expression [ NOT ] IN { <scalar-query> | ( <value> ,...n ) }
  | expression [ NOT ] BETWEEN expression [ AND ] expression
  | [ NOT ] EXISTS { <column-value> | <scalar-query> }
  | expression [ NOT ] EQUIV expression
  | expression <inequality-operator> { ALL | ANY } { <scalar-query> | ( <value> ,...n ) }
```

### binary operators

```
= | <> | != | > | >= | !> | < | <= | !<
```

Whitespace is not required between operands and operators, except when the left operand is a numeric literal.

### logical operators

- AND: logical conjunction
- OR: logical disjunction (takes precedence over AND)
- NOT: negates the succeeding predicate
- use parentheses to override precedence

### BETWEEN

Tests for inclusion in a range (inclusive on both ends). Test expression, begin, and end must be the same type. End must be greater than begin.

### IN

Tests membership in a set of values or a scalar CTE query.

### EXISTS, EQUIV, ALL, ANY

Defined in parser; EXISTS and EQUIV available when outer joins are implemented. ALL and ANY not yet implemented.

### scalar queries in predicates

A `<scalar-query>` is a CTE alias that selects one column. It can be used with IN, EXISTS, ALL, ANY operators.

## common table expressions (CTEs)

CTEs are defined with WITH and referenced by alias:

```
WITH ( <crud-txn> ) [ AS ] <alias>
```

- CTEs produce a relation for further use by other CTEs, JOINs, SELECT, or predicates
- always referenced by alias, never inlined
- multiple CTEs can be chained
- predicates can reference CTEs (e.g., WHERE col IN cte-name)

## scalar functions

### control flow

```
IF <predicate> THEN <expression> ELSE <expression> ENDIF
CASE <expression> WHEN <expression> THEN <expression> [ ...n ] [ ELSE <expression> ] END
COALESCE ( <expression> [ ,...n ] )
```

### arithmetic operators

```
+ | - | * | / | ^
```

Precedence: `^` highest, then `*` `/`, then `+` `-`. Exponentiation is right-associative; all others left-associative. Whitespace required before the next operand.

### datetime functions

- GETUTCDATE() returns current UTC @da
- DAY(<expression>) extracts day (1-31) as @ud from @da
- MONTH(<expression>) extracts month (1-12) as @ud from @da
- YEAR(<expression>) extracts year as @ud from @da

### mathematical functions

- ABS(<expression>) absolute value
- CEILING(<expression>) smallest value >= expression
- FLOOR(<expression>) largest value <= expression
- LOG(<expression> [, <base>]) logarithm
- POWER(<expression>, <expression>) exponentiation
- ROUND(<expression>, <precision> [, <rounding-fn>]) rounding
- SIGN(<expression>) returns -1, 0, or 1
- SQRT(<expression>) square root

### string functions

- LEN(<expression>) string length as @ud
- LEFT(<expression>, <n>) leftmost n characters
- RIGHT(<expression>, <n>) rightmost n characters
- SUBSTRING(<expression>, <start>, <length>) substring (1-based start)
- TRIM([<chars>,] <expression>) remove leading/trailing characters
- CONCAT(<expression> [,...n]) concatenate strings

## time travel

Almost all urQL commands support an optional AS OF clause:

```
<as-of-time> ::=
  AS OF { NOW
        | <timestamp>
        | n { SECOND[S] | MINUTE[S] | HOUR[S] | DAY[S] | WEEK[S] | MONTH[S] | YEAR[S] } AGO
        | <time-offset>
       }
```

- default is NOW (current server time)
- in SELECT FROM, AS OF controls which data state of the table/view is queried
- in DDL commands, AS OF back-dates or future-dates schema changes
- WARNING: future dating locks the database until that future time
- DROP DATABASE leaves no trace for time travel

## query results

All commands return a `cmd-result` (`sur/obelisk.hoon:71`):

```hoon
+$  cmd-result  [%results (list result)]
+$  result
  $%
    [%action action=@t]          :: command or query executed
    [%relation relation=@t]  :: table used or effected
    [%message msg=@t]
    [%vector-count count=@ud]    :: number of rows affected or returned
    [%server-time date=@da]      :: current server wall-clock time
    [%security-time date=@da]    :: security timestamp
    [%schema-time date=@da]      :: schema (DDL) timestamp for queried objects
    [%data-time date=@da]        :: data (DML) timestamp for queried objects
    [%result-set (list vector)]  :: rows returned by a SELECT
    ==
```

A `vector` is one result row: a non-empty list of `vector-cell` (`sur/obelisk.hoon:154`):

```hoon
+$  vector-cell  [p=@tas q=dime]   :: p=column-name, q=[aura atom]
+$  vector       $:  %vector  (lest vector-cell)  ==
```

### SELECT result sequence

`select-results` (`lib/crud.hoon:503`) assembles the `(list result)` for a query. The sequence depends on whether CTEs or joins are present.

**Simple query (no CTEs / single relation):**

```
[%action 'SELECT']
[%result-set (list vector)]
[%server-time @da]
[%schema-time @da]
[%data-time @da]
[%vector-count @ud]
```

**Query with CTEs or joins** — each source table is listed first (sorted by ship, database, namespace, name, then timestamps), followed by the main SELECT block:

```
:: per source table (non-CTE, non-sys):
[%relation <database>.<namespace>.<table>]
[%schema-time @da]
[%data-time @da]

:: then the SELECT block:
[%action 'SELECT']
[%result-set (list vector)]
[%server-time @da]
[%vector-count @ud]
```

Internal CTE tables (ship=`~`, database=`%cte`, namespace=`%cte`) are skipped in the result header output.

## system views

Available for introspection queries:

| View | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| sys.sys.databases | all databases on server and state change events (only in %sys database) |
| sys.namespaces | namespaces in a database |
| sys.tables | tables with admin info (namespace, name, agent, tmsp, row-count) |
| sys.table-keys | primary key columns per table |
| sys.foreign-keys | declared foreign keys, one row per parent/child column pair |
| sys.columns | table columns (namespace, name, col-ordinal, col-name, col-type) |
| sys.sys-log | schema state change history |
| sys.data-log | data state change history |

## formatting conventions

1. keywords should be ALL UPPER CASE (not required, strongly encouraged)
2. aliases may be mixed case; title case (upper case first character) encouraged
3. object names always lower case per @tas rules
